                    <p>Our planet is getting hotter faster than ever before. This isn't normal - it's caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels. We're already seeing the effects with more extreme weather, melting ice, and rising sea levels.</p>
                    <div class="evidence">
                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> NASA says Earth's temperature has gone up by 1.1Â°C since the 1800s, and it's still rising.

                    <p>We're losing species at an alarming rate - this is called the sixth mass extinction. When animals disappear, it affects entire ecosystems and food chains. Many animals we love might not be here for future generations.</p>
                    <div class="evidence">
                        <strong>Shocking fact:</strong> Wildlife populations have dropped by 68% since 1970, according to WWF.

                    <p>Clean, safe drinking water is becoming harder to find. Pollution, overuse, and climate change are making water shortages worse. By 2025, two-thirds of people on Earth might not have enough clean water.</p>
                    <div class="evidence">
                        <strong>Right now:</strong> 2.2 billion people don't have access to safe drinking water.

                    <p>Dirty air is making people sick and causing millions of deaths every year. It affects our lungs, hearts, and even our brains. Kids and elderly people are especially vulnerable to air pollution.</p>
                    <div class="evidence">
                        <strong>Scary truth:</strong> 91% of people worldwide breathe air that's worse than what the World Health Organization says is safe.

                    <div class="evidence">
                        <strong>By 2050:</strong> Climate change could cost the world economy $23 trillion - that's more money than most countries make in a year.
